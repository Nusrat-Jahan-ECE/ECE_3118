# **Git**

> ***Git** is a distributed version control tool that can manage a programmer's source code history.*

 It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

Git is foundation of many services like **GitHub** and **GitLab**, but we can use Git without using any other Git services. Git can be used privately and publicly.

# **GitHub**
> ***GitHub** is a Git repository hosting service. It is a web-based service.*

GitHub is an online service to store code and push from the computer running the Git tool. GitHub focused on centralized source code hosting.

# **Git Commands:**

Git supports many command-line tools and graphical user interfaces. The Git command line is the only place where we can run all the Git commands.

Here is a list of basic Git commands that are used daily:

# **1. Git Config Command**

The Git config command is the first and necessary command used on the Git command line. This command sets the author name and email address to be used with your commits. Git config is also used in other scenarios. 

**Syntax**
```
git config --global user.name "Nusrat-Jahan-ECE"  
git config --global user.email "1710011@student.ruet.ac.bd"
````
# **2. Git Initialization**

To create a blank repository, open command line on your desired directory and run the init command as follows:
```
git init
````
# **3. Git Status Command**

The status command is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It also lists the files that you've changed and those you still need to add or commit.

**Syntax:**
```
git status
````
